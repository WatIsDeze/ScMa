# SchizoMania:
SchizoMania is a game about a character called Dave who is quite deranged.
Since we do not intend to do spoilers, think about Resident Evil 3 mixed up with Silent Hill 2 to get an idea about what it's intent is.

``Wait, no… Our house. 
It’s not mine anymore. I don’t have the keys, where did I sleep last night? 
How did I-

“Get back here Dave or i’m calling the pigs on your wife-beating ass!” 
I look back and see Jamie following me, baseball bat in hand. 


I don’t know where I’m supposed to go. Do I even still have a home? I’m not sure I even know where I am right now. I had to have known where I was to get to the liquor store but I don’t even remember where it is located. 
This is wrong. This is bad. What is happening?

I need to ask Jamie for help.

I turn around and nothing.
He’s not there. 
Where did he go?
Where am I?``

For those of you who do want to read the Chapter 1 spoiler, I suggest you go to the dev_docs folder.
